# Flutter Clean Architecture & TDD BLoC Advanced Tutorial

This project is a comprehensive implementation of Flutter Clean Architecture using the TDD (Test Driven Development) approach and BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern. It is based on the tutorial [Flutter Clean Architecture & TDD BLoC Design Pattern | Industry Standard Code | Project Based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E3EF1jPumM).

## Overview

The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate a robust architecture that follows the principles of Clean Architecture while integrating BLoC for state management. It provides an in-depth understanding of:

- **Clean Architecture**: Exploring the separation of concerns and maintaining a scalable and maintainable codebase by dividing it into distinct layers: presentation, domain, and data.
- **TDD (Test Driven Development)**: Utilizing test-driven development methodology to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase through rigorous testing.
- **BLoC Design Pattern**: Implementing BLoC for efficient state management and separation of UI components from business logic.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture Implementation**: Showcase the implementation of clean architecture principles in a Flutter project.
- **TDD Approach**: Emphasize the importance of writing tests before implementing functionality.
- **BLoC for State Management**: Demonstrate the usage of BLoC as a design pattern for managing state in Flutter applications.
